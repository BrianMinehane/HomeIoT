Connecting my Samsung home oven for IoT
I've just bought a Samsung Internet enabled oven (Wow). WLAN - Home connect enabled.
The model is Q700 Single oven with microwave & pulseSteam HN678GES6B black, stainless steel. Product ID HN678GES6B.
The Home Connect function includes: - iService Remote, Remote Monitoring and Control.
This is what I want to connect up to remotely - ideally using MSFT Azure via my home Internet connection.
